  * 0_process_00_reportkill: Backport a fix from src-mirror that stops Cfagent
    erroneously reporting signals it will never make.

    by src/conf.h.

cfengine2 (2.0.5final-3) unreleased; urgency=low

  * A little clarification about the previous release (2.0.5final-2). The
    patch (0_cfservd_00_sec) stops hosts which were in the DynamicAdresses
    list from having implicit access to all files.
  * Add undocumented experimental DefineInGroup feature to editfiles. If
    you want to see how it works, look in the mailing-list or at patch
    0_editfiles_00_definegroup.
  * Add undocumented experimental EmailMaxLines special variable. If you
    set it to a number or "inf", cfexecd limits its emails to this number
    of lines of cfagent output.
